# Diabetes Prediction API

This application provides a prediction API for diabetes diagnosis, developed with FastAPI, and an interactive user interface created with Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: For creating the REST API.
- **Streamlit**: For the interactive user interface.
- **Google Cloud Run**: For deploying the API and making the service accessible online.



## Testing

I performed tests to ensure that the API functions as expected. The tests were conducted locally before deployment, ensuring all features were operational.

## Conclusion

This application offers a simple and effective solution for predicting diabetes risk. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your needs.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Google Cloud Run. Here is the base URL to access the API:

```python
URL_BASE = 'https://diabeteprediction-975813296636.europe-west9.run.app'
